Hello Professor Syed Jawad Hussain Shah,

I hope you are doing great.

Please let me explain what I have included here :
For this project, since the database was very large, I did not use Google Colab and ran everything locally instead.

In the data folder, I downloaded the 2019-Nov.csv dataset from the website you provided:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mkechinov/ecommerce-behavior-data-from-multi-category-store

Unfortunately, since the CSV file is about 9 GB, I was not able to upload it to GitHub. 

Also, I used Jupyter Notebook to create and run the .ipynb file locally, which you can find the ipynb in the Notebook folder.

I also created a PowerPoint presentation and saved it as a PDF, which is included here and explains the work in more detail. This is the file I prepared for the presentation.

Thank you for your time and for everything you taught us during this semester.
